# ZSH Configuration

Super simple ZSH configuration using [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit). Includes:

- [Starship](https://starship.rs) prompt
- BSD-based colorization (when `LSCOLORS` is defined)
- Autoquoting pasted URLs
- Completions for `docker`, `docker-compose`, and anything added to `~/.zfunc`
